# NFT Marketplace

This project is a decentralized NFT marketplace built using Scaffold-ETH. It allows users to create their own NFT collections, view them, and interact with them in a decentralized environment.

## Features

- **NFT Collection Creation**: Users can create their own NFT collections from images stored at IPFS URLs.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: The application is fully decentralized with no backend.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Each NFT collection deploys a new smart contract on-chain.
- **Wallet Integration**: Users can connect their Ethereum wallet to interact with the platform.

## Tech Stack

- **Scaffold-ETH**: A framework for building Ethereum dApps.
- **Foundry**: For smart contract development and testing.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Secure and reusable smart contract templates.
- **Next.js**: React-based framework for building the frontend.
- **Wagmi**: Library for wallet integration and blockchain interaction.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage for images and metadata.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for testing transactions

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-marketplace.git
   cd nft-marketplace
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start a local Ethereum network:
   ```bash
   yarn chain
   ```

2. Deploy the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

- **Connect Wallet**: Use the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your Ethereum wallet.
- **Create NFTs**: Upload images and mint NFTs directly from the platform.
- **View Collections**: Browse through created NFT collections.

## Future Enhancements

- **On-chain Transactions**: Add smart contract interactions for on-chain payments and tipping.
- **Enhanced Security**: Improve security features for decentralized content sharing.
- **Video Uploads**: Allow users to upload videos directly through the platform.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues related to the `make` command on Windows, ensure that you have installed `mingw32-make` or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to provide a Unix-like environment.
